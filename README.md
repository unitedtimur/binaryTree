This data structure is a binary tree.

1. In the TheBinaryTree.cpp file, you need to create your own tree and add elements to it through the method or simply create a node and pass the method to learn the information.
2. A binary tree is implemented as a template, hence it is possible to fill with any type of data.
3. And also you can read data from your files.
